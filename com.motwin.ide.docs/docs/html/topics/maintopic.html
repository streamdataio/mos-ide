	<p> </p>
	<p>Motwin Operation Server (mOS) runs server-side apps and manages the communications between clients and back-ends, cloud services, and third party providers. It is built to host high-performance applications.</p>
	<p>                                                                </p>
	<p>Motwin server-side SDK is used to build the shared business logic for multiple clients (iOS, Android or HTML5 - mobile or Web.)</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Mobile (iOS and Android) and HTML5 SDKs permit developers to create optimal applications leveraging the server-side business logic and focusing primarily on a rich and engaging user experience. </p>

	<h1>Motwin Architecture</h1>
	<p>Mobile is triggering changes in how applications are consumed and delivered. Transitioning to a more flexible application delivery architecture is critical for enterprises that want to stay in the competition. A middleware platform that enables an efficient API management while decoupling back-ends (DB, Cloud Service, Legacy systems) from mobile applications is critical to deliver modern and efficient applications. Motwin server provides all the key infrastructure support services for the management, delivery, and security of APIs and enables enterprises to deliver business services rapidly, securely and consistently.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Motwin architecture makes development of applications for different mobile operating systems highly efficient and powerful. The code developed on the server is used by each mobile application, minimizing the amount of code required for each mobile platform you need to develop and maintain.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-87" title="Motwin Architecture" src="../assets/img/Motwin_architecture.png" alt="" /></p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>The runtime Motwin server sits between mobile devices and the enterprise information systems (Legacy systems, Cloud services) and acts as a mediator in charge of fetching and aggregating data from various sources to bridge the gap between legacy infrastructure and the fast changing world of Cloud and mobile.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Motwin provides mobile SDKs for each of today's major mobile operating systemts to allow developers to consistently access their back-end services in a unified manner regardless of the type of applications they are building (native, Web or Hybrid).</p>
